<p>Since horseback riding and bowmanship were

learning to use guns, which at that time were still too heavy and awkward for a horseman to load

<p>9.	By the beginning of the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire was at its peak. </p>
</div>
<div data-role="page" id="question10">
Is it licit according to the shari�a to fight the followers of the
Safavids? Is the person who kills them a holy warrior, and the
person who dies at their hands a martyr?
Answer: Yes, it is a great holy war and a glorious martyrdom.
Assuming that it is licit to fight them, is this simply because
of their rebellion and enmity against the [Ottoman] Sultan of
the People of Islam, because they drew the sword against the
troops of Islam, or what?
Answer: They are both rebels and, from many points of
view, infidels.
Can the children of Safavid subjects captured in the Nakhichevan
campaign be enslaved?
Answer: No.
The followers of the Safavids are killed by order of the Sultan.
If it turns out that some of the prisoners, young and old,
are [Christian] Armenian[s], are they set free?
Answer: Yes. So long as the Armenians have not joined the
Safavid troops in attacking and fighting against the troops of
Islam, it is illegal to take them prisoner.
</div>
<div data-role="page" id="question11">
As military technology evolved, cannon and lighter-weight firearms played an ever-larger role
on the battlefield. Accordingly, the size of the Janissary corps�and its cost to the government�
grew steadily, and the role of the Turkish cavalry diminished. To pay the Janissaries, the sultan
started reducing the number of landholding cavalrymen. Revenues previously spent on their living
expenses and military equipment went directly into the imperial treasury. Inflation caused
by a flood of cheap silver from the New World bankrupted many of the remaining landholders,
who were restricted by law to collecting a fixed amount of taxes. Their land was returned to the
state. Displaced cavalrymen, armed and unhappy, became a restive element in rural Anatolia.
This complicated situation resulted in revolts that devastated Anatolia between 1590 and 1610.</div>
<div data-role="page" id="question18">
Outwardly, the Ottoman capital of Istanbul looked quite different from Isfahan (is-fah-HAHN),
which became Iran�s capital in 1598 by decree of Shah Abbas I (r. 1587�1629). Built on seven hills
on the south side of the narrow Golden Horn inlet, Istanbul boasted a skyline punctuated by
the gray stone domes and thin, pointed minarets of the great imperial mosques. The mosques
surrounding the royal plaza in Isfahan, in contrast, had unobtrusive minarets and brightly tiled
domes that rose to gentle peaks. High walls surrounded the sultan�s palace in Istanbul. Shah
Abbas in Isfahan focused his capital on the giant royal plaza, which was large enough for his
army to play polo, and he used an airy palace overlooking the plaza to receive dignitaries and
review his troops</div>
<div data-role="page" id="question20">
The harbor of Istanbul, the primary Ottoman seaport, teemed with sailing ships and smaller
craft, many of them belonging to a colony of European merchants perched on a hilltop on the
north side of the Golden Horn. Isfahan, far from the sea, was only occasionally visited by Europeans.
Most of its trade was in the hands of Jews, Hindus, and especially a colony of Armenian
Christians brought in by Shah Abbas.</div>

<div data-role="header"><h1>Trade</h1></div>
Izmir transformed itself between 1580 and 1650 from a small town into a multiethnic, multireligious,
multilinguistic entrep�t because of the Ottoman government�s inability to control
trade and the slowly growing dominance of European traders in the Indian Ocean. Spices from
the East, though still traded in Aleppo and other long-established Ottoman centers, were not
to be found in Izmir. Aside from Iranian silk brought in by caravan, European traders at Izmir
purchased local agricultural products�dried fruits, sesame seeds, nuts, and olive oil. As a consequence,
local farmers who previously had grown grain for subsistence shifted their plantings
more and more to cotton and other cash crops, including, after its introduction in the 1590s,
tobacco, which quickly became popular in the Ottoman Empire despite government prohibitions
(see Environment and Technology: Tobacco and Waterpipes). In this way, the agricultural
economy of western Anatolia, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean coast�the Ottoman lands
most accessible to Europe (see Map 19.1)�became enmeshed in a growing European commercial
network.</div>
<div data-role="page" id="TaxFarming">
Rural administration, already disrupted by the rebellions, suffered from the transition to tax
farms. The former military landholders had kept order on their lands in order to maintain their
incomes. Tax farmers were less likely to live on the land. The imperial government therefore
faced greater administrative burdens and came to rely heavily on powerful provincial governors
or on wealthy men who purchased lifelong tax collection rights and behaved more or less like
private landowners.</div>
<div data-role="page" id="question15">
Aleppo and Damascus, however, the Janissaries came out on top. Meanwhile, in central
Arabia, a puritanical Sunni movement inspired by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab began a
remarkable rise beyond the reach of Ottoman power. Although no region declared full independence,
the sultan�s power was slipping away to the advantage of a broad array of lower officials
and upstart chieftains in all parts of the empire while the Ottoman economy was reorienting
itself toward Europe.
</div>
<div data-role="page" id="question16">
Ismail proclaimed himself shah of Iran and declared that from that
time forward his realm would be devoted to Shi�ite Islam, which revered the family of Muhammad�s
son-in-law Ali. Although Ismail�s reasons for compelling Iran�s conversion to Shi�ism are
unknown, the effect of this radical act was to create a deep chasm between Iran and its neighbors,
all of which were Sunni. Iran became a truly separate country for the first time since its
incorporation into the Islamic caliphate in the seventh century</div>
<div data-role="page" id="question17">
neighbors had long been in the making. Persian, written in the Arabic script from the tenth
century onward, had emerged as the second language of Islam. Iranian scholars and writers
normally read Arabic as well as Persian and sprinkled their writings with Arabic phrases, but
their Arab counterparts were much less inclined to learn Persian. After the Mongols destroyed
Baghdad, the capital of the Islamic caliphate, in 1258, Iran developed largely on its own, having
more extensive contacts with India�where Muslim rulers favored the Persian language�than
with the Arabs.</div>
<div data-role="page" id="question21">
The private side of family life has left few traces, but it is apparent that women�s society�
consisting of wives, children, female servants, and sometimes one or more eunuchs�was not
entirely cut off from the outside world. Ottoman court records reveal that women, using male
agents, were very active in the urban real estate market. Often they were selling inherited shares
of their father�s estate, but some both bought and sold real estate on a regular basis and even
established religious endowments for pious purposes</div>

  Why should every child learn how to program?

Technology is radically changing every area of our society, from communication to government to how we do our jobs. Digital literacy is now a fundamental skill like reading and writing.

By learning to program, kids can have a say in how software shapes their world. Plus, programming teaches important reasoning, logic, and communication skills.

Though she denied the connection, she is often identified as a Surrealist. She was married to muralist Diego Rivera (1929, separated 1939, remarried 1941).

In 1925 Kahlo was involved in a bus accident that so seriously injured her that she had to undergo some 35 medical operations. During her slow recovery from the trauma, Kahlo taught herself to paint. She showed her early efforts to Rivera, whom she had met a few years earlier, and he encouraged her to continue to paint. After their marriage, Kahlo traveled (1930–33) with Rivera, who had received commissions for murals from several cities in the United States. In 1938 she met André Breton, a leading Surrealist, who championed her work; both Breton and Marcel Duchamp were influential in arranging for some of the exhibits of her work in the United States and Europe. In 1943 she was appointed a professor of painting at La Esmeralda, the Education Ministry’s School of Fine Arts. Her house in Coyoacán is now the Frida Kahlo Museum. The Diary of Frida Kahlo, covering the years 1944–54, and The Letters of Frida Kahlo were both published in 1995.</div><div data-role="collapsible"><img src="http://media2.school.eb.com//eb-media/36/93336-004-24D196CE.jpg"></div></div></div>
